# RFC 0003 - Embedded 3rd Party Interfaces

## Summary

Extension from RFC0001. Zesty.io needs a way for a 3rd Party UI to be loaded inside of the instance manager application.

## Motivation

To allow for extensibility of our SaaS API, we need a way for developers to extend our interface to work both with our APIs and their custom build 3rd party solutions. The ability to do this drives towards an open 3rd party marketplace that will customers and developers ways to solve problems outside of our core offering.
